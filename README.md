# Accident-Prone-Zone-Detection-using-Computer-Vision

# 📌 Project Description

This project uses **Computer Vision** techniques to analyze traffic videos and identify **accident-prone areas**. By detecting vehicles and pedestrians from video frames, the system studies traffic density and movement patterns. Based on these observations, it classifies road conditions into different **risk levels** such as low, medium, and high.

The project demonstrates how **AI and image processing** can be applied to real-world problems like road safety and traffic monitoring.


# 🎯 Objectives

* To analyze traffic videos using Computer Vision
* To detect vehicles and pedestrians automatically
* To study traffic density and interaction patterns
* To identify potential accident-prone zones
* To visualize results using graphs and images

## ⚙️ How the Project Works

1. A traffic video is given as input
2. The video is converted into frames
3. Objects such as vehicles and pedestrians are detected
4. Traffic density and distance metrics are calculated
5. Risk level is assigned based on traffic conditions
6. Results are displayed using graphs and annotated frames
